### Directory Structure

The project directory structure is as follows:

```
├── android
├── build
├── images
├── ios
├── lib

├── pubspec.yaml

```

Let me explain the other directories besides **lib**:

| directory | explain                |
| --------- | ---------------------- |
| asset     | images for android app |

Then the lib directory

![lib](images/lib.png)

| main.dart | Main App Startup   |
